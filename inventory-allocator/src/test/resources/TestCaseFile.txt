// Instructions on writing test case
// 1. The first line starts with '#' character followed by the testcase name.
//	This name is used in the test file to fetch the testcase.
// 2. The last line of the test case should be a '$' character to indicate the end of test case.
// 3. The order is provided in a single line starting with "Order:" followed by the items and 
//	their quantity with an equal sign ('=') between them. The different items are 
//	separated by a colon (':') character.
// 4. The warehouses can be provided in multiple lines with each line containing the warehouse
//	name and inventory. The warehouse input should start with "Warehouse:" followed by the 
//	warehouse name and ':'. After this, the items in the inventory are mentioned with an 
//	'=' sign between item name and quantity and different items separated by ':'.
// 5. The output is provided in as many lines as the number of warehouses in the result. Each 
//	of these line starts with "Result:" followed by the warehouse name and item and 
//	quantity in a similar way as described in warehouse.
// 6. An empty order or result can be provided by mentioning the keyword "Order" or "Result" 
//	in a line.
